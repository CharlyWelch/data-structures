# data-structures
Collection of sample code for a number of common data structures in Python.
This repository will be added to sequentially. In it you will find:

**Singly-Linked List**
- **Module**: 'linked.py'
- **Tests**: test_linked.py
- **Time Complexity**: 

**Doubly-Linked List**
- **Module**: 'dll.py'
- **Tests**: test_dll.py
- **Time Complexity**: 


# Notes on Data Structures:

## Singly-linked vs. Doubly-linked lists:
A singly-linked list may be the more appropriate data stucture to implement when making use of last-in-first-out structure, and it is not necessary to traverse the entire list in order to find a specific value. If you will need to flip back and forth through the data, a doubly-linked list will be more approporiate.
